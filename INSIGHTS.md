Conclusions and Insights
After analyzing the dataset and visualizing various aspects, here are the key conclusions and insights:

1. Price Distribution
Most used cars are priced between ₹2,00,000 and ₹10,00,000.
High-end luxury cars (like BMW and Mercedes-Benz) significantly increase the average price in the dataset, skewing the overall price distribution toward higher values.
2. Kilometers Driven vs. Price
Cars with higher mileage generally have lower prices, as expected.
Some exceptions are observed for well-maintained or luxury vehicles, where higher mileage does not drastically reduce the price (e.g., BMW 5 Series).
3. Fuel Type Preferences
Diesel Cars: Popular among higher mileage vehicles, indicating their use for long-distance travel. Prices for diesel cars show a wide range, from budget-friendly to luxury.
Petrol Cars: More common in the lower mileage range, suggesting urban or personal use. They are generally more affordable than diesel cars in this dataset.
4. Transmission Type
Manual transmission cars dominate the dataset, indicating their popularity in the market.
Automatic transmission cars are priced higher, especially in premium brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
5. Brand Trends
Maruti Suzuki: The most listed brand, reflecting its dominance in the Indian car market. Cars are priced in the affordable segment, typically between ₹2,00,000 and ₹7,00,000.
Toyota: Known for durability, models like Innova hold value well despite higher mileage and age.
Luxury Brands (e.g., BMW, Mercedes-Benz): These brands command significantly higher prices, even with older models and second ownership.
6. Ownership
Second-owner cars dominate the dataset, possibly due to their affordability and availability in the market.
First-owner cars are generally newer models and command higher prices, reflecting their better condition and fewer issues.
7. Age of Cars
Older cars (10+ years) are priced lower, aligning with general depreciation trends.
Relatively new cars (1-5 years) retain higher value, especially premium models like the Kia Carnival.
8. Year vs. Price Trend
A strong correlation is observed between the year of manufacture and the price.
Newer models command higher prices, while older models are more affordable.
Exceptions include iconic or well-maintained models, which retain value better than others despite being older.
